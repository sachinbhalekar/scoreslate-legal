# Privacy Policy for Score Slate

**Effective Date:** June 21, 2025

Welcome to Score Slate! This privacy policy explains how Utilix ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our mobile application, Score Slate (the "App").

Your privacy is our absolute priority. The core design principle of Score Slate is that **all data you enter is stored exclusively and privately on your device.**

---

### 1. The Short Version (Our Core Privacy Promise)

We believe in radical transparency. Here's what you need to know in plain English:

-   **We Do Not Collect Personal Information:** The app does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal data like your email, name, or location.
-   **All Data Stays On Your Device:** Every game name, player name, and score you create is stored only in a local database on your phone or tablet. We do not have servers, and we cannot see, access, or use your data.
-   **The App Works Completely Offline:** No internet connection is required for any feature. The app does not transmit any of your data over the internet.
-   **You Are in Complete Control:** You can delete any game record at any time. You can delete all of your data simply by uninstalling the app.

---

### 2. Information We Handle

Score Slate only processes information that you explicitly provide to enable the app's functionality. We do not collect any information automatically. The information handled by the app includes:

-   **Game Information:** The names you give to the games you play (e.g., "Catan," "Family Game Night").
-   **Player Information:** The names or nicknames you enter for players in each game (e.g., "Alice," "Bob").
-   **Scoring Data:** The scores you enter for each player, including the history of score changes and the timestamps of those changes. This data is used to build the scoreboard and the score progression chart.
-   **Game State Data:** Information about a game, such as whether it is in-progress or finished, and its creation date.

---

### 3. How Your Information Is Used

The information you provide is used solely for the following purposes, all of which occur **only on your device**:

-   To provide the core functionality of the app, such as displaying the scoreboard and calculating scores.
-   To save and display your list of in-progress and finished games.
-   To calculate and display the "Player Leaderboard" based on win counts from your finished games.
-   To generate the score progression chart for a specific game.
-   To pre-populate the "New Game" screen when you use the "Replay" feature.

### 4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention

-   **Storage:** All information is stored in a local SQLite database within the App's private, sandboxed storage directory on your device. This storage is protected by the mobile operating system (iOS or Android) and is not accessible by other apps.
-   **Security:** We rely on the built-in security features of your mobile operating system to protect the app's local data.
-   **Retention and Deletion:** Your data is retained on your device for as long as you use the App. You have full control over your data:
    -   You can delete individual game records at any time using the delete icon on the home screen. This action is permanent.
    -   Uninstalling the Score Slate application from your device will permanently delete the app's local database and all of your game data.

### 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your data with any third parties. Period.**

Since all data resides only on your device and is never transmitted to us or anyone else, there is no data to be shared or disclosed. The App does not contain any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

### 6. Children's Privacy

Score Slate does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information. The App is designed for a general audience. Since we do not collect or transmit any personal data, we believe the App is safe for users of all ages. If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns, please contact us.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
